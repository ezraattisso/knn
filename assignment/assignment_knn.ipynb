        "**Q0 Answer**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Regression helps predict actual numbers like house prices or someone's age, while classification sorts things into specific groups like \"spam\" or \"not spam.\" With regression, you're trying to figure out \"how much\" or \"how many,\" but classification is all about deciding \"which category\" something belongs to. You can think of regression as predicting a point on a line - like exactly how tall someone is - while classification is more about putting things in different boxes - like deciding if they're tall, medium, or short.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. A confusion table shows how well a classification model is doing by displaying predicted labels versus actual labels in a handy grid format. It helps us see not just overall accuracy, but also where our model messes up - like if it's confusing one class for another or making specific types of errors. You can calculate cool metrics from it like precision (how many positive predictions were actually positive), recall (how many actual positives did you catch), and F1-score which is a balance between precision and recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. SSE, or Sum of Squared Errors, measures how far off your model's predictions are from the actual values by adding up all the squared differences. It basically tells you how much your model is missing the mark - the smaller the SSE, the better your model is fitting the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Overfitting happens when your model gets too obsessed with the training data and learns all its quirks and noise, making it perform poorly on new data. Underfitting is the opposite where the model is too simple and doesn't capture important patterns in the data, basically missing the point entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Splitting your data lets you see how your model performs on new information it hasn't \"seen\" before, which is what actually matters in real life. By trying different k values and checking the accuracy or SSE on test data, you're finding the sweet spot where your model isn't too simple or too complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Predicting a class label is simple and easy to interpret, but it doesn’t tell you how confident the model is, which can be risky if mistakes are costly. On the other hand, giving a probability distribution provides more insight into uncertainty, helping with decision-making like setting confidence thresholds, but it can be harder for non-technical people to use directly. The trade-off is between clarity and flexibility—labels are straightforward, while probabilities let you weigh risks and adjust accordingly.\n",
